CandidVote is a secure blockchain-based voting system that aims to eliminate the potential security threats associated with tampering of votes, ensuring truthful and reliable results. This system can be utilized by organizations, businesses, or individuals who require user polls to make informed decisions.

## Problem
In traditional voting systems, there is a risk of corrupt results due to the possibility of vote tampering.

## Solution

### Benefits of Using Blockchain

- Enhanced Security: The distributed nature of blockchain ensures that votes are secure and difficult to tamper with.

- Scalability: The system is designed to handle larger elections efficiently.

## Testing

- Frontend: Visual testing using Git web app, incorporating customer/user feedback for iterative improvements.
- Backend: Jest and Supertest for unit testing and integration testing.
- Blockchain: Integrated testing suite in the Truffle framework for blockchain testing.

## Future Scope

- Real-Time Vote Tracking: Implement functionality to view live votes fetched from the blockchain during an ongoing voting session.
- Live Result Updates: Display live results for ongoing events and update charts accordingly.
